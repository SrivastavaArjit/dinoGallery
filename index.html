              have lived on land. Their skin was scaly, like repltile skin, but some dinosaurs had feathers, too. The
              smallest adult dinosaurs known were about the size of today's birds. All dinosaur babies were tiny when

          The Cretaceous is the third and final period of the Mesozoic Era, as well as the longest. The name is derived
          fromt the Latin creta, "chalk", which is abundant in the latter half of the period. It was a period with a
          relatively warm climate, resulting in high eustatic sea levels. During the Early Cretaceous, flowering plants
          appeared and began to reapidly diversify, becoming the dominant group of plants across the Earth. The
          Cretaceous ended with the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, a large mass extinction in which many groups,

            <p class="NonVeg"><span class="h4">Spinosaurus</span> would have been a frightening sight, with its
              dragon-like sail and
              supersharp teeth. The huge sail stood 6 feet above the back. It was supported by bony spines. It's
              nostrils were high up on its nose so that msot of its head could reach into water. Scientists thought that
              dinosaurus ate only meat or plants, until they discovered Spinosaurus- it was a meat-eater that caught and
              ate fish, too.

              legs, and short arms that could barely reach its mouth. It's bite was eight times more powerful than a
              lion's. T-rex had teeth with edges as sharp as knives, to cut through flesh, and as thick as bananas, to
              chomp through bone.

            <p class="NonVeg"><span class="h4">Velociraptor</span> was a small but ferocious predator that probably
              hunted in packs. It was a feathered carnivore with a long tail and an enlarged sickle-shaped claw on each
              hindfoot, which is thought to have been used to tackle and tear into prey. They can be distinguished from
              other dinosaurs by its long and low skull, with an upturned snout. Velociraptor was roughly the size of
              the turkey, and is well known to paleontologists, with over a dozen described fossil skeletons.
